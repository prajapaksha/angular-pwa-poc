## What is a PWA?

A **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** is a type of web application that uses modern web technologies to provide a native app-like experience to users. PWAs combine the best features of web and mobile applications, offering users fast, reliable, and engaging experiences across all devices and network conditions.

PWAs are built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but incorporate advanced features that make them behave like native mobile applications.

## Core Technologies

### 1. Service Workers

Service Workers are background scripts that enable many PWA features:

**Features Enabled:**
- Offline functionality
- Push notifications
- Background sync
- Caching strategies
- Network request interception

**Example Service Worker Registration:**
```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/ngsw-worker.js')
    .then(registration => console.log('SW registered'))
    .catch(error => console.log('SW registration failed'));
}
```

### 2. Web App Manifest

A JSON file that provides metadata about the web application:

**Example Manifest:**
```json
{
  "name": "My PWA Application",
  "short_name": "PWA App",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. HTTPS Requirement

- Required for service workers and many PWA features
- Ensures security and data integrity
- Enables secure context for advanced APIs

## Testing PWA Functionality

### Method 1: Chrome DevTools Network Tab
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Check the "Offline" checkbox
4. Refresh the page or navigate around your app
5. Verify the app still works offline

### Method 2: Chrome DevTools Application Tab
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Application tab
3. Click on "Service Workers" in the left sidebar
4. Check the "Offline" checkbox next to your service worker
5. Test your app functionality

### Method 3: Physical Network Disconnection
1. Disconnect your Wi-Fi or unplug ethernet cable
2. Try to refresh the page or navigate around your app
3. The app should continue working for cached resources

### Method 4: Chrome's Network Throttling
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Click the dropdown that says "No throttling"
4. Select "Offline"
5. Test your app

### What to Look For When Testing Offline:
- ✅ App loads when offline
- ✅ Navigation works between pages
- ✅ Static content displays properly
- ✅ Service worker shows as active in DevTools
- ✅ Cached resources are served from cache
